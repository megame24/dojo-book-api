Ideas:

- Stars for streaks (Consider including in first release)
 - 1 day streak
 - 1 week streak
 - 1 month streak
 - 6 months streak
 - 12 months streak

- Notification system (Don't have to be real time for first release)
 - Notify when you achieved a streak
 - " when approaching a goal (1 day before, email and in-app)
 - Notify at an arbitrary time of the day if a streak is about to be broken

- Follow and explore system
 - Social network module??

- Explore removing report and admin intervention from private logbooks????!!!!

- Make the URLs more user friendly by using username instead of IDs

- App wide refactor (You can create helper functions in each class [adapters, useCases, entities])

- LET'S MAKE IT A MOBILE APP!!!!! :)
